# Deleting a Certificate

Deleting a Kubernetes Certificate resource will cause the `kube-cert-manager` to delete the following items:

* The Kubernetes TLS secret holding the Let's Encrypt certificate and private key.
* The Let's Encrypt user account registered for the domain.

## Delete a Certificate

kubectl delete certificates psg-dot-io
```
