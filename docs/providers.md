# Configuring your challenge provider(s)

## HTTP

kube-cert-manager will answer HTTP challenges on port 8080,
you will need to setup a proxy or service definition that correctly directs requests on your domain on port 80 to the kube-cert-manager
If using a proxy, only `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` needs to be forwarded to the kube-cert-manager. Please note, kube-cert-manager
matches the `Host` header of the request; it must be passed through the proxy.

## TLS

kube-cert-manager will answer TLS-SNI challenges on port 8081
You will need to setup a port forwarder or service definition that correctly directs packets on your domain on port 443 to the kube-cert-manager.
This provider is not very convenient when needing to serve a website on the actual domain, due to needing exclusive access on port 443.
As such, it is not recommended.


## DNS Providers

kube-cert-manager uses environment variables within the pod to fetch credentials required for various DNS providers.
Making those correctly accessible to kube-cert-manager will require editing the pod deployment spec at k8s/deployment.md

The recommended way to do this is to mount secrets as either environment variables or as files, depending on what the provider requires.
See [Using secrets as environment variables](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables) and [Using secrets as files from pods](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod)
